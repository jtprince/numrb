= Numrb

An experimental library aimed at providing support for numeric arrays that are manipulatable with C inside ruby using FFI-inliner.  This is meant to be as stable and full featured as the other Num** but slightly more enchanting.

== Examples

require 'numrb'

a = Numrb[10,20,30,40]
a = Numrb([10,20,30,40])
a = Numrb.new(dtype, size, ...) #initialize with 0
